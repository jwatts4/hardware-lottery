# Hardware Lottery

This program is meant to read in an it-inventory.xlsx file and a preferences.xlsx file, then
allocate computers in the inventory to users in accordance with their preferences. The results
of the allocation algorithm will be written to a new `allocations.xlsx` file in the data/ folder.
